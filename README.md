**CS325 Compiler Coursework - Test Cases**

This contains a bash shell per category which automatically runs the tests held within. These tests simply compile and run the file with accordance to your mccomp.cpp file.
Some do not compare results, and simply echos what should have happened - so you will need to manually compare.

The tests are compiled from different sources including Cult tests, Goodman etc. None are mine, I merely joined them together.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

Move hardertests, mediumtests and vanilla into your /tests/

Replace your exterior tests.sh with the tests.sh found here.
  

Cheers dits!
Alex.
